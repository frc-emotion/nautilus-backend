Important note before we begin: Ensure you have a proper understanding of Git and its development pipeline before contributing to any repository. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) is a great introductory video.

**Install these:**

Main dependencies: Python 3.13, Pip, Visual Studio Code, Git

Once you have everything installed, clone the repository by running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frc-emotion/nautilus-backend.git
```

You may be prompted to enter authentication details. For this, you may need to generate a Personal Access Token to use as your GitHub Password. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) if you need instructions.

Once the repository is successfully cloned onto your machine, install all necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After you have completed these steps, your development environment should be fully set up, making you ready for development and writing your first contribution.
